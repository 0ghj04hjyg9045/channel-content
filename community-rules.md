# Techlore Community Rules
***Spreading privacy & security to the masses***

We host several communities to offer a place for people to chat about privacy and learn from other community members. We believe in offering a tier-based system: from non-privacy services to heavily-privacy-respecting to cater to all possible audiences and give them a place to chat about privacy. Our goal is for members to start in community 1 and end up in community 3. To better accomodate this transition, we've bridged communities 1 & 3 so they can directly communicate with each other. Even if they decide not to switch, we are aware of varying threat models and are happy to accomodate community members of all levels.

 ## Rules
 
 ### 1
 We are building awareness related to privacy and security; be a healthy part of the solution.
 
 ### 2
 Create an environment where people arenâ€™t afraid to speak. This means no personal bashing, no excessive trolling, and disagreements should be kept civilized. If something gets out of control, message a mod/admin(s) about the matter. Personal squabbling dealt with publicly in the community will lead to action towards all involved parties.
 
 ### 3
 Everyone deserves equal treatment and an ability to interact with the community. No gatekeeping!
 
 ### 4
 To incorporate all demographics, NSFW content is not allowed.
 
 ### 5
 Illegal content is not allowed. This includes (but isn't limited to) illegal licenses, cracked programs, illegal content, or illegal acts towards specific person(s). Security and privacy must be dissociated with illegal activities.
 
 ### 6
Respect the mods with moderation decisions. Reach out directly to myself with mod abuse, do not take matters into your own hands--the mod will always win.

### 7
For Matrix & Discord communities, refrain from discussing topics unrelated to the room/channel you're in.

### 8
A ban in any of our communities applies to all other Techlore communities as well.

**The consequence of breaking a rule depends on the severity of the act. This is left to the sole discretion of any admins or moderators. 3 mutes or warns will result in a ban.**
