A consistent challenge I face is realizing I made a mistake on a video I already published. Perhaps I misread an article, forgot to include important statistics, etc. I hope to post my scripts with sources and information in this repo to make sure the community can verify my information before I begin production. 

This is brand new, so I'll be updating this over time for improvements.
